# Human-Swarm-Interaction-By-Using-Coverage-Over-Time-Varying-Domains
A coverage control algorithm over time-varying domains is used to control robotic swarms. A reference signal of a domain's motion can be input by human through tablets or joysticks in real time.
The publication of the control algorithm can be found here (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9147326).
The code is constructed upon the simulation paltfrom from Robotarium (https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) at GeorgiaTech; the simulator can be downloaded here (https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator). Note: Run the "init.m" file in the simulator before trying the simulations of the control presented here.
The script includes both simulation and experiment. The protion of code for experiment is constructed for Khepera IV differential drive robots and Vicon Motion Capture system. Set the simulate_flag to 1, the code will work.
